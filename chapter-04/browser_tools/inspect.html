<!-- what you can do with Inspect Tools: -->

<!-- 

we can See the copy of orginal source  code of webpage(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of any website in element tab

we can edit webpage like html element,css but those edits only affect your browser’s copy — they don’t change the original website or server code. that is it changes temoralry

Inspect allows developers to make live editing & testing until the design looks good. Then the developer copies those edits to the actual source code.

Example:
If JavaScript changes

<p id="msg">Hello</p>
to
<p id="msg">Welcome!</p>

View Page Source still shows Hello (original).
Inspect shows Welcome! (updated live).


Check mobile view (see how the website looks on phone/tablet).
usefull for debugging and testing 
include console for java script
hightlights selected element on page
See network activity (what files the page is loading, like images, CSS, data).

In short: Inspect lets you play with the website’s design and code in real-time.
