what you can do with Inspect Tools:

See the code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of any website.

Change text or images on the page (only for you, temporary).

Change styles (colors, fonts, sizes, background).

Hide or delete elements (like ads, buttons, etc.).

Check mobile view (see how the website looks on phone/tablet).

Debug errors if you are a developer.

See network activity (what files the page is loading, like images, CSS, data).

ðŸ‘‰ In short: Inspect lets you play with the websiteâ€™s design and code in real-time.
