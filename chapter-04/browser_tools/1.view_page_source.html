<!-- Key points about View Page Source: -->

<!-- When you right-click on a webpage and select "View Page Source"It shows the original HTML file that the server sent to your browser. -->

<!-- Linked files (CSS, JavaScript, images). -->

<!-- What you don’t see directly:

Changes made by JavaScript after the page loads. (For that, you need "Inspect" → "Elements" in DevTools).

Backend code (like PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.) since that runs on the server, not in your browser. -->

<!-- In short:
View Page Source = The raw code sent from the server.
Inspect / DevTools = The live, dynamically updated version of the page (with JavaScript changes). -->
