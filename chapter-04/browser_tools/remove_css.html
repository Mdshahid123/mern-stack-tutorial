 <!-- When you open Inspect (DevTools), you can temporarily remove or change CSS to see how the page looks without styling. -->

<!-- Hereâ€™s how you can remove CSS: -->
 Method 1: Disable a single CSS rule

Right-click on the element â†’ Inspect.

In the right side Styles panel, youâ€™ll see the CSS rules applied.

Uncheck the box next to each rule (like color: red;, font-size: 20px;).

The style will be removed instantly.



Method 2: Remove entire stylesheet

In Inspect, go to the Sources or Network â†’ CSS tab.

Find the .css file linked (like style.css).

Right-click on it â†’ Disable / Block request URL (in Chrome).

This removes the whole CSS file.



ğŸ”¹ Method 3: Quick hack (remove all CSS)

In Inspect â†’ Console, paste this code:
Array.from(document.styleSheets).forEach(sheet => sheet.disabled = true);
