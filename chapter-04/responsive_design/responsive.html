A responsive website should be made in such a way that:

It can change its layout or adapt the layout based on the screen size.

On a big screen (desktop/laptop), the content can be spread out, side by side.

On a small screen (mobile/tablet), the same content should automatically stack or resize so it fits nicely.

ðŸ”¹ How do we make it responsive?

Use flexible units (like %, em, rem) instead of fixed px.

Use CSS tools like Flexbox and Grid to arrange elements flexibly.

Use Media Queries in CSS to apply different styles for different screen sizes.

(Optional) Use frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS which already have responsive features.

ðŸ”¹ How can we see responsiveness?
By using Inspect â†’ Toggle Device Toolbar to check how the website looks on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
