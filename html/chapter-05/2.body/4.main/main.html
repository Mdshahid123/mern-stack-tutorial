<!-- What is main content in a webpage -->
It is  a unique and central content of a webpage

. Blog post content
. News article text
. Product descriptions on an e-commerce site
. Tutorials, videos, or images that form the pageâ€™s focus


<!-- now question is which tag we have to use to create a main content  of a website  -->
.  we can use <div></div> tag to create a main but it is generic tag that is non semantic tag so it  does't specifi the perpose of content so it would not be a se friendly and screen reader friendly so instead of div tag we should use <main></main> tag.

    
. <main></main> tag is a semantic  tag it specifi the meaning or purpose of the content so         obviuosly it would be se friendly as well as screen reader friendly.

. should appear only once per Page.
