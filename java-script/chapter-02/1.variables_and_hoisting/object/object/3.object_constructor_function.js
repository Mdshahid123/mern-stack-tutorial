// Object Constructor Functions
// Sometimes we need to create many objects of the same type.
// To create an object type we use an object constructor function.
// It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.


// example:Object Type Person

function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}
// Note:
// In the constructor function, this has no value.

// The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.

// Now we can use new Person() to create many new Person objects:

// Example
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
const mySister = new Person("Anna", "Rally", 18, "green");

const mySelf = new Person("Johnny", "Rally", 22, "green");
console.log(myFather)
