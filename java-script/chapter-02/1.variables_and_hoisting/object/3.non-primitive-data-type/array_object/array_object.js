// Array An array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in an ordered list.

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

console.log(fruits[0]); // apple
console.log(typeof fruits); // "object"


// ðŸ”¹ Arrays are indexed starting from 0.
// ðŸ”¹ They are also objects internally, which is why typeof gives "object".
