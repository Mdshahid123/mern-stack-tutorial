 <!-- what is java script?? -->
java script is a light weight prototype based,supported multi paradigm,single threaded, dynamic typed and interpreted  programming langauge which is used to give instruction to the computer

In Browser environment it is interpreted by  the interpreter V8-engine (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), JavaScriptCore (Safari) 

In node-js environment it is interpreted by the interpreter  V8 engine(the same one used in Google Chrome)
but Node.js adds extra modules on top of V8 — like fs (file system), http, and os — so you can use JavaScript outside the browser to build servers and tools.
