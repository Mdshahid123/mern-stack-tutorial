<!--there are two types of length unit used to descibe the length of the element in css-->
 

1)absolute length unit:absolute length unit like pixel(px) is fixed length unit 
if we expressed the css  length property in pixel  then will always take that size irrespective of the screen size.

but size of each phisical pixel will very from device to device 
this is bcz big screen has less dense and small screen has more dence 
so obviosly size of each phyiscal pixel will be small as compared to the large screen


 2)relative length unit:Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property

 

<!-- example -->
em-Relative to the font-size of the element

rem-Relative to font-size of the root element	

vw-Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport

vh-Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport

vw-Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport

%-Relative to the parent element
