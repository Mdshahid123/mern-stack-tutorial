<!--Is it possible to create a 2D layout using CSS flex box?-->

Yes, it is possible to create a 2D layout using CSS flex box.
but it will be very complex to create a 2D layout using css flex box because flex box is mainly designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.


So instead of css css grid is used to make a 2D layout or arrangment.

<!-- css grid work in two steps -->

first step is to make a Two Day Layout by using grid-template-rows and template-column-gap

stpe-02-filled the row and column by using box(not give them a size)
