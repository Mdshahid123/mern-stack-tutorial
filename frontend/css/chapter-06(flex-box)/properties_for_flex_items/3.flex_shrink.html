flex-shrink controls how much a flex item shrinks
when there isn’t enough space in the flex container.

In simple words:
“If the container is too small to fit all the items, flex-shrink decides which items give up space (and how much).”


Case 1: Default (flex-shrink: 1)

Each box shrinks equally to fit in the container.

So each loses (450 - 300) / 3 = 50px,
final size ≈ 100px each.




Case 2: Different shrink values
.box1 { flex-shrink: 1; }
.box2 { flex-shrink: 2; }
.box3 { flex-shrink: 1; }


➡️ Total shrink factor = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
The total 150px space shortage is divided in that ratio (1:2:1):

box1 loses 37.5px

box2 loses 75px (shrinks twice as much)

box3 loses 37.5px

So box2 becomes the smallest because it has the highest flex-shrink





case 3:don't want to shrink

flex-shrink:0



Property	   When it works	                   What it does
flex-grow	   When extra space is available	Grows items to fill the space
flex-shrink	   When there’s not enough space	Shrinks items to fit the space
