<!-- what is flex-grow -->

flex-grow is a CSS Flexbox property that controls how much a flex item should grow (expand) relative to other flex items when there is extra space available in the flex container

by default all boxes have flex-grow: 0 —so each box stays 100px wide, and the remaining space stays empty.



note:If there is NO available (vacant) space Then flex-grow does nothing.Because:flex-grow only works when there’s extra free space left in the flex container after laying out all the items with their base sizes (flex-basis or width).


for example if Each box is 100px, and the container is 300px.
So — 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 → no extra space remains.
Therefore, flex-grow has no visible effect — boxes stay the same width.
