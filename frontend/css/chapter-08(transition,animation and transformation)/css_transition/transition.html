<!-- what is css transtion -->

A CSS transition is used to make changes a state or style value between two styles or two states(intial and final state) smooth and gradual on user action(like:-hover,active,focus and visited) instead of happening instantly

In simple words:

Transition makes the change of style or state value  (like color, size, or position) happen slowly and smoothly over time.


<!-- Example: Without vs With Transition -->

<!-- Without transition (instant change) -->
button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

-> The color changes suddenly when you hover.


<!-- With transition (smooth change) -->
button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s; /* 0.5 seconds smooth effect */
}

button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

->The color changes gradually from blue â†’ red.
