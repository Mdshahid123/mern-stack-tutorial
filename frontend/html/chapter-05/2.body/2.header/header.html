<!-- Header in a Webpage -->

<!-- The header is the top content of a webpage .
It usually contains:

. Website logo or brand name

. Navigation menu (links to other pages/sections)

. Search bar

. contact info -->


<!-- question:- now question is which tag we have to use to create a header of a website  -->
 <!-- ans:- div tag we can use to create a header but it is generic tag that is non semantic tag so it does't specifi the perpose of content so it would not be a se friendly so instead of div tag we should use <header></header> tag

. <header></header> tag is a semantic  tag it specifi the meaning or purpose of content so obviosly it would be se friendly.
