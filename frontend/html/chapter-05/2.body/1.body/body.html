<!-- 1.Why we should put content inside <body>? -->

The <body> contains everything that should be visible to users on the webpage.

Search engines (SEs) like Google read the <body> to understand what the page is about.

If content is outside <body>, SEs may ignore it or not give it importance.


<!-- 2.To create a contnent on the webpage we should use semantic tags or non semantic tag inside <body>? -->
After knowing the content exists, SEs also need to know what kind of content it is.

so for this we should use Semantic tags bcz it tell SEs and screen readers about the role and meaning of the content.

Examples:
<header> → top content of the webpage

<nav> → Navigation links.

<main> → The main unique content of the page.

<section> → A thematic grouping of content.

<article> → Independent piece of content (like a blog or news post).

<footer> → Bottom information of the page.

<!-- 3. SEO Benefits of Semantic Tags -->

Better SEO Ranking: Search engines can index your content more accurately.

Accessibility: Screen readers can explain the page better to visually impaired users.

Maintainability: Developers can easily understand the structure of your page.

<!--  so conclustion is: -->
Put all visible content inside <body> → so SEs know what’s on the page.
Use semantic tags inside <body> → so SEs know what type of content it is.
