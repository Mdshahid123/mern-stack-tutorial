<!-- Key points about View Page Source: -->

<!-- When you right-click on a webpage and select "View Page Source"It shows the original HTML file that the server sent to your browser. -->

<!--It shows the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exactly as written by the developer (before JavaScript runs and changes anything).

If developer wrote
<p id="msg">Hello</p>
you will always see "Hello" in View Page Source — even if JavaScript later changes it.

<!-- What you don’t see directly:

Changes made by JavaScript after the page loads. (For that, you need "Inspect" → "Elements" in DevTools).

Backend code (like PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.) since that runs on the server, not in your browser. -->

<!-- In short:
View Page Source = The raw code sent from the server.
Inspect / DevTools = The live, dynamically updated version of the page (with JavaScript changes). -->
