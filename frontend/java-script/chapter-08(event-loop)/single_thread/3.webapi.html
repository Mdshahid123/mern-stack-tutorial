<!-- The browser has implemented varius functionalities using multithreading. Each functionality (timers, network, rendering, storage, GPU, etc.) runs on its own thread so the browser can perform multitasking efficiently.

for example:Running JavaScript,Handling user events,Rendering the UI,Playing audio/video,Managing timers,Making network calls,Doing background tasks -->


<!-- these functinality implemented in a c++ program -->


<!-- To run these functinality browser exposes varius api called web api -->

<!-- example -->

<!-- JS calls an async function -->

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("done");
}, 2000);

 <!-- JS thread gives this request to the Timer thread of the browser -->

<!-- JS says:Timer thread, please handle this.” -->

<!-- Timer thread counts 2 seconds -->

<!-- JS is free now. -->
<!-- After 2 seconds, Timer thread sends callback to the Event Loop -->
<!-- Event loop checks if the JS thread is empty. -->
<!-- If JS thread is free, callback goes to the call stack and executes -->

→ Prints: "done"
