//what is ascii code

//we can't store  string   directly in a memory bcz computer can only store a binary number so first we have to  give  a constant  numerical number to these chracter of stirng 

//then it can be store as a binary after compilation in memory

//for this we use ASCII CODE AND UNICODE


//Each Character Has a Code called ASCII code
//Each character in a string is converted into a numeric code.

For example (in ASCII):

example:
character code: s
decimal:83
binary code:01010011

h 104 01101000
a 97 01100001
h 104 01101000
i 105 01101001

Each ASCII character takes 1 byte (8 bits) of memory.
