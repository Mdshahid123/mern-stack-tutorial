what is ascii code

-we can't store  string   directly in a memory bcz computer can only store a binary number so first we have to  give  a constant  numerical number to these chracter of stirng 

-then it can be store as a binary after compilation in memory

-for this we use ASCII CODE AND UNICODE


-Each Character Has a Code called ASCII code
-Each character in a string is converted into a numeric code.

For example (in ASCII):

example:
character: s
ASCII code:83
binary code:01010011


example:2
character:h
ASCII code:104
binary code:01101000




Each ASCII character takes 1 byte (8 bits) of memory.
