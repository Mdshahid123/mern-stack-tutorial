<!-- When JavaScript Was Created -->
Year: 1995
Creator: Brendan Eich

Company: Netscape Communications (the company that made the early “Netscape
Navigator” browser)

Why It Was Created
In 1995, the web was mostly static — web pages only contained text and images
written in HTML.
There was no interactivity — no buttons, pop-ups, or dynamic content.

So Netscape wanted a lightweight scripting language to:

Make web pages interactive,

Run directly in the browser,

Be easy to learn for non-programmers.

Brendan Eich created the first version of JavaScript in just 10 days

Timeline of JavaScript Evolution
Year Event
1995 JavaScript created by Brendan Eich (initially called Mocha, later
LiveScript, and finally JavaScript)
1996 Microsoft created its own version called JScript for Internet Explorer
1997 JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript by ECMA International
2009 Node.js was created — allowing JavaScript to run outside the browser
2015 Major update ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced modern features like let,
const, arrow functions, classes, promises, etc.
Today JavaScript powers almost every modern web application — from frontend
frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) to backend (Node.js).

<!-- is java and java script is same?? -->

Fun Fact:

Despite the name, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java
Netscape named it “JavaScript” for marketing reasons — because Java was popular
at that time.

<!-- In short: -->
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape to make web pages
dynamic and interactive.
