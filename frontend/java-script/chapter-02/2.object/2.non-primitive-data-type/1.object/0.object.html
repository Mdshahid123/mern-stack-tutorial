<!-- what is object? -->
An object is a representation of a real-world entity that stores its data
(properties or attributes) and defines operations or algorithm (methods or
behaviors) that can be performed on that data.
or
object encapsulates data and behavior of an real world entity.

->diffrent programming language represent the object in diffrent format

Object in java script:in java-script An object is represented as a in key-value
pairs format. like

student={
name:"sohan",
age:24,
city:'delhi'
marks:{
maths:55,
english:56,
hindi:78
}

}

it can store a collection of deffrent data types that is primitve and non
primitve as well

object is mutable that means it can be modifi

Objects accupied a space in a heap and varaible pointing to it accupied in a
stack

// now question how object data type organised in a heap memory ?

//Object are organized in heap memory using hash data table(internally array)

// example
let person = {
name: "Shahid",
age: 21,
isStudent: true,
obj: {

},
findage: function age() {

},

};

// hash("name") → 12 → "Shahid"
// hash("age") → 23 → 22
// hash("city") → 7 → "Delhi"
//hash("obj")->8 ->refrence of an nested object
