// In JavaScript, data types are mainly divided into two categories:

1)Primitive Data Types
2)Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

1)Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types)

Definition:Non-primitive data types are those which can hold multiple values and
are stored by reference (not directly in the variable’s memory).
When you assign or copy them, you’re actually copying the reference (memory
address), not the actual value.

#Difference between Primitive and Non-Primitve

#Primitive
1)Stored By value
2)mutable immutable
3)Creates a new copy
Examples String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt

#nonprimitive
1)stored By reference
2)immutable
3)Copies only the reference
Examples:Object, Array,Function
