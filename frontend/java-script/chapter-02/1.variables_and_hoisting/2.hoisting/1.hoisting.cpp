// before understanding hoisting first understand how execution of program happen in anther language

// exp:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "value of a :" << a;

  int a = 9;
}

// in another langauage memory allocation is happen when program  is run
// that is execution and memory allocation  both happen at run time
