// java script execution work in two phase
// 1)memroy allocation or creatin phase:before executing any java script code java script engine read or scan your code and allocate the memory to all variable and function it find

//2)execution phase:after setting up memory,engine goes back through  the code  line by line and excute it(assign vaule ,call function etc)


// let's see the practical demonstration to support above statment 

console.log(a)
var a=9
