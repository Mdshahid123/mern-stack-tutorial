<!-- What is DOM -->
<!-- dom stand for document object model -->

<!-- 🌳 Why It’s Called “Document Object Model”? -->

Document → Your HTML page

Object → Everything becomes an object

Model → Tree structure

The browser converts HTML into a tree structure of objects, and the DOM API lets us control that tree.

<!--It’s a tree-like data  structure which represent our html document,browser creates it  when it loads an HTML page or webpage or html document -->

<!-- where each node of dom represnts   everything in the webpage (HTML elements,comment, and text) as objects that JavaScript can access and modify using web api -->

<!--web api provide dom api (window object)to intract with dom  -->
