<!-- Question 2: Append Multiple Elements -->

Task:When the button is clicked, add two paragraphs inside a <div> using a single append() method.

<!-- HTML: -->
<div id="container"></div>
<button id="btn">Add Paragraphs</button>

<!-- Requirements: -->

Create two <p> elements.

Add different text in both.

Use container.append(p1, p2) to add both at once.
