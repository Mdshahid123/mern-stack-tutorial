<!-- inline evenets is not a good way to handle a events bcz html code will bcome a bulky -->

<!-- better way to handle a events is that write a js code separately -->

<!-- 2) handling events using property -->

node.eventname=function(){
    //handle the event here
}

<!-- limitaion:on one element we handle one event at a time -->
