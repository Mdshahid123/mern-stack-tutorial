// features  of function

//1)modularization:function is a way to implememnt modularization that is we spllit  bigger task(like calculator) into the sevral smaller tasks(add,sub,mul,div) to reduce the complexity of a program 

//2)Readability:Functions improve the readability of the code  

///Now anyone reading the code instantly understands what diffrent  fucntion does.
//Easier to maintain, test, and reuse.



//3)A function allows you to write code once and reuse it multiple times.

//4) Memory Utilization (or “Memory Optimization”):Functions use memory only when they run — and free it when done.That’s why they help our program use memory efficiently.

//But without functions, all variables stay in memory until the program ends,so they keep occupying memory unnecessarily and make the program less efficient.
