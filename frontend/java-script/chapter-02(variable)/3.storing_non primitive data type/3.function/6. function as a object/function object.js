//in JavaScript, when you define a function, it’s actually treated as a  object That means it has properties and methods(call, apply, and bind etc) just like other objects.

//When you define a function:

function sum(num1,num2) {
  console.log(num1+num2);
  console.log(greet.arguments) //return array of arguments
  console.log(greet.name)
}

sum(1,2)

//Internally, JS creates a Function object — something like:

greet={
  name: "greet",
  length: 2,
  argument:[1,2],
  prototype: { constructor: greet },
  __proto__: Function.prototype,
  //Internal Slots (hidden, not directly visible)
  // [[Code]]: reference to function code
  // [[Environment]]: scope where it was defined
  // [[Call]]: internal method to execute
}
