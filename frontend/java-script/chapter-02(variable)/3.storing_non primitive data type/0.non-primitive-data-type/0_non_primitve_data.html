1)Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types)

Definition:Non-primitive data types are objects that contain both data and methods.

-These objects are stored in heap memory, while the variable holds a reference to the object.

-When you assign or copy them, you’re actually copying the reference (memoryaddress), not the actual value.
