1️⃣ Normal websites (multi-page apps)

Each time the user goes to a new page, the browser sends a request to the server.

Server responds with a full HTML page, which the browser renders.

Example: click on “About” → server sends about.html → page reloads.

✅ Problem: slow, state is lost, lots of requests.

2️⃣ Single Page Application (SPA) approach

You send one single HTML page (index.html) to the browser at the first visit.

This page is mostly empty, e.g.,

<div id="root"></div>
<script src="app.js"></script>


After that, all content is created dynamically using JavaScript.

Example using plain DOM:

const root = document.getElementById("root");

// Home Page
function renderHome() {
  root.innerHTML = "<h1>Home Page</h1>";
}

// About Page
function renderAbout() {
  root.innerHTML = "<h1>About Page</h1>";
}

// Navigation
document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.id === "homeBtn") renderHome();
  if (e.target.id === "aboutBtn") renderAbout();
});


Notice: no new request to the server is sent, because the page is already loaded.

Only JavaScript changes the DOM, making it feel like you are navigating to new pages.

3️⃣ Why this is the only way to avoid page reloads

Browser cannot display a page that doesn’t exist yet without sending a request.

By sending one empty page and letting JS insert content:

The page never reloads.

Navigation feels instant.

State (variables, UI info) is preserved.

⚡ Summary

Traditional websites → page reloads for every new page → requests go to server.

SPA (empty index.html + JS DOM) → load once → all other content is created dynamically → no page reloads → no extra server requests.

Basically, React, Vue, or Angular just automate this approach:

Dynamically render content

Efficiently update DOM

Manage routing and state

…so you don’t have to manually write all DOM manipulation code.
