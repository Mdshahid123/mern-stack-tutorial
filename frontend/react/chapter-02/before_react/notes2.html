<!-- there is a need of library like react which should have React + local server(vite)+compiler(bable) -->


<!-- What you want in your library -->

If you were to make your own React-like library, it would need to do at least three main things:


<!-- 1. Convert JSX to JavaScript -->

JSX is not valid JS, browsers don’t understand it.

You need a compiler (like Babel) to convert JSX into something like:

<h1>Hello</h1>

into 

React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello")

This allows your library to create DOM elements dynamically.



<!-- 2. Provide a Virtual DOM / Runtime -->

To avoid manually manipulating the DOM for every change, your library should:

Maintain a virtual DOM (a JS representation of the real DOM).

Compare old and new virtual DOM (diffing).

Efficiently update only the parts of the real DOM that changed.

This is exactly what React does behind the scenes.




<!-- 3. Serve a Local Dev Server -->

To make development fast and smooth, you need a local server:

Serves your initial empty HTML (index.html).

Serves JS/CSS files.

Supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) — updates the page instantly when you change code.

Tools like Vite already handle this part.
