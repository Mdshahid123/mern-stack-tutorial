                  <li>
                      If we divide a computer into parts, we get five main components: input
                      devices, output devices, memory, CPU, and the operating system
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Input devices, output devices, memory, and CPU are hardware, whereas the
                      operating system (OS) is software (system software)
                  </li>
                  <li>
  
                      Input devices – Used to give data and instructions to the computer (like keyboard,
                      mouse).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Output devices – Show the results from the computer (like monitor, printer).
                  </li>
                   <li>
  
                       Memory – Stores data, both temporarily (RAM) and permanently (hard disk/SSD)
                   </li>
                   <li>
  
                       Operating System (OS) – The Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as
                       a bridge between application software and hardware, and also provides an interface
                       for users to interact with the computer hardware

                 <h3>0.2 How computer Work</h3>
                 <ul>
                  <li>
                      CPU (Central Processing Unit) is called the brain of the computer. Internally,
                      CPU is connected to all hardware devices through physical wires called
                      the system bus.
                 </li>
                  <li>
                      The system bus (physical wire) acts as a communication pathway between
                      the CPU and other components like memory, input devices, output devices,
                      and storag
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      CPU decides what task each component should perform.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Whenever a task needs to be done (such as fetching data from memory,
                      saving to the hard disk, displaying something on the screen, or sending
                      signals to the NIC (Network Interface Card) for network requests), the CPU
                      sends a signal/instruction to that component through the system bus
  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Then, the component completes the task and sends the result back to the
                      CPU as a signal.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       However, the CPU does not generate signals on its own; it requires
                      instructions to perform a task.
  
                   </li>
                   <li>
  
                       This set of instructions is called a program.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Programs are written in high-level languages such as Python, JavaScript, C,
                       C++, etc.

                          Ans: Writing instructions directly in binary (low-level language) is very difficult and
                          time-consuming for humans.
                          That’s why we write programs in high-level languages like Python, Java, or C++.
                          These programs are then translated (compiled or interpreted) into binary (machine
                          code) so the computer can understand and execute them.

                 <h3>0.4 Role of Operating System</h3>
                 <p>
                     
                     As we know, to perform any task in a computer we have to give an instruction to the
                     CPU.
                     For example, if we want to send a network request, the CPU must send signals to the
                     NIC (Network Interface Card) through the system bus, and then the NIC does its
                     job.
                      But writing those low-level(hardware level) instructions directly would be very difficult, because we
                     would need detailed knowledge of how every hardware device works.
                     Instead of writing harware level coding,as application developers, we simply call the that hardware level code(written in os )from our program which then communicates with the hardware on our behalf
                     So basically, in our application, we write what we want to do, not how to
                     do it.
