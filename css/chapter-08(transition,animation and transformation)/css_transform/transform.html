<!-- What is transform in CSS? -->

The transform property in CSS is used to change the shape, size, and position of an HTML element without affecting other elements around it.

<!-- In simple terms: -->

The transform property allows you to move (translate), rotate, scale (resize), or skew (tilt) an element on the page.

When we said “transform changes the shape, size, and position of an element it means

1. Position

-> It means moving the element from one place to another — left, right, up, or down.
This is done using translate().

transform: translate(50px, 100px);


-> The element moves 50px right and 100px down,
but it doesn’t affect other elements’ layout (like margin or position would).

2. Size

➡️ It means making the element bigger or smaller — like zooming in or out.
This is done using scale().

transform: scale(1.5);


-> Makes the element 1.5 times bigger.
If you use scale(0.5), it becomes half the size.

3. Shape
->It means rotating or tilting the element, which changes how it looks (its shape visually).
This is done using rotate() and skew().

transform: rotate(45deg);

Rotates the element 45 degrees.


transform: skew(20deg, 0deg);
-> Tilts (slants) the element horizontally — changes its shape appearance.
 
<!-- Common Transform Functions -->
Function	                    What it does	                      Example
translate(x, y)	   Moves the element left/right or up/down   transform: translate(50px, 20px);
rotate(angle)	         Rotates the element	                        transform: rotate(45deg);
scale(x, y)	       Changes size (x = width, y = height)	      transform: scale(1.5, 1.5);
skew(x, y)	       Tilts the element	                      transform: skew(20deg, 10deg);
matrix()	     Combination of all the above (advanced)	 transform: matrix(...)




<!-- note transform can be happen in 2-D plane as well as 3-D plane -->


  transform changes how an element looks (its position, angle, or size),
  while transition controls how smoothly that change happens.
