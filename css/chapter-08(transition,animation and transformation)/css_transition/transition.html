<!-- what is css transtion -->

A CSS transition is used to make changes between two styles or two states smooth and gradual instead of happening instantly.

In simple words:

Transition makes the change of style (like color, size, or position) happen slowly and smoothly over time.


<!-- Example: Without vs With Transition -->
<!-- Without transition (instant change) -->
button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

-> The color changes suddenly when you hover.


<!-- With transition (smooth change) -->
button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s; /* 0.5 seconds smooth effect */
}

button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}


->The color changes gradually from blue â†’ red.
