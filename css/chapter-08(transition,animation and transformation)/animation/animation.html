Animation is like a transition, but it happens automatically.”

In simple words:
Animation makes change it's states  automatically  when page load or(we can set it to start)— you don’t need user actions like hover or click.

Transition → needs a trigger (like hover, click, focus).
Animation → runs automatically, no trigger needed.

<!-- Example to remember it easily: -->

1)animation-name:The name of the animation (must match the one in @keyframes)

example:animation-name: moveBox;


2)animation-duration:How long one cycle of the animation takes	
example:
animation-duration: 2s;

3)animation-timing-function:How the speed of the animation changes (slow/fast)
example:

4)animation-delay:How long to wait before the animation starts
