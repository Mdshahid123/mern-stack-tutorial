<!-- What is Animation in CSS? -->
Animation is like a transition, but it happens automatically.‚Äù

In simple words:

Animation makes change it's states  automatically  when page load or(we can set it to start)‚Äî you don‚Äôt need user actions like hover or click.

Transition ‚Üí needs a trigger (like hover, click, focus).

Animation ‚Üí runs automatically, no trigger needed.

<!-- Example to remember it easily: -->

Concept	Simple Meaning
Transition	‚ÄúChange smoothly when something happens.‚Äù
Animation	‚ÄúChange smoothly on its own.‚Äù

<!-- following proerties are  used in animation -->

1)animation-name:The name of the animation (must match the one in @keyframes)

example:animation-name: moveBox;


2)animation-duration:How long one cycle of the animation takes	
example:
animation-duration: 2s;

3)animation-timing-function:How the speed of the animation changes (slow/fast)
example:
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;

4)animation-delay:How long to wait before the animation starts	
example
animation-delay: 1s;

5)animation-iteration-count:How many times the animation should repeat	
example
animation-iteration-count: infinite;

6)animation-direction:Whether to play animation forward, backward, or alternate	animation-direction: alternate;



<div class="box"></div>

<style>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;

  /* Animation properties */
  /* animation-name: moveBox;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-delay: 1s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards; */
}

/* Keyframes define the movement */
@keyframes moveBox {
  from {
    left: 0;
    background: red;
  }
  to {
    left: 200px;
    background: blue;
  }
}
