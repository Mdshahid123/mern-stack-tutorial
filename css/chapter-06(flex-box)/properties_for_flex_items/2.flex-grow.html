<!-- flex-grow:flex-grow controls how much a flex item grows relative to the other items inside a flex container when there is extra space available. i.e flex-grow decides how much extra space a flex item should take  after all items have taken up their minimum space. -->

<!-- by default all boxes have flex-grow: 0 —so each box stays 100px wide, and the remaining space stays empty.
  -->


note:

If there is NO available (vacant) space

Then flex-grow does nothing.

Because:flex-grow only works when there’s extra free space left in the flex container after laying out all the items with their base sizes (flex-basis or width).


for example if Each box is 100px, and the container is 300px.
So — 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 → no extra space remains.
Therefore, flex-grow has no visible effect — boxes stay the same width.
