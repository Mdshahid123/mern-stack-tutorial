<!-- what is css flex model??-->

<!-- By using the CSS Flexbox model, we can arrange or lay out the child elements  of a container in a better way by aligning and distributing space between them. -->
<!--flex container is a responsive container  -->


<!-- when we set the display:flex to the container or element or box then container

→ becomes a flex container but still behaves normally as per (block or inline).

→ its direct children (.box) become flex items arranged in a main axis (default x-axis) or cross axis(depending on flex-direcion properties)

Not affected unless their parent also has display: flex.-->
