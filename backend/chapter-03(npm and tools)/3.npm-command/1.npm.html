What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?

->NPM is a package manager(comes with nodejs) that helps you to install dependencies or dependent library of your project

How NPM Works?
When you run:npm install express

->It sends a request to the NPM registry (a online database  server that stores all java script packages or library).

->It downloads the package (express) and saves it in the node_modules folder.

->It updates the package.json and package-lock.json files.



If you run:npm install -g nodemon
It installs globally (accessible from anywhere on your system).
