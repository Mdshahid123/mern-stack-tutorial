const mongoose=require("./mongoose")
let object=new mongoose("5bhk",5,"mumbai")
let error=object.save()
if(error)
  console.log(error)
else{
  console.log("succfull data is saved ")
}

//there is a problem and prblem is that as we know that here save is a asynch task(time taking process) so we should print error or succesfull msg once the data has been saved in file 

//so for this we use call back function or asynch await
