what is mvc ?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected components:

1. Model: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving it from a database, processing it, and updating it. The Model is independent of the user interface.

2.View: The View is the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data provided by the Model to the user and for capturing user input. The View is typically composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web applications.

3.Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it (often by interacting with the Model), and then updates the View accordingly. The Controller contains the application logic that determines how to respond to user actions.

In summary, the MVC pattern helps to separate concerns(responsiblity) within an application, making it easier to manage and maintain. The Model handles data and business logic, the View manages the user interface, and the Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and the View.
